## UK
This site is designed no to be over complicated with simplisity in mind, this site is done to keep the user intrested with clear accessible way to navigate to the different pages. The navigation bar has the sites name with the three navigation lines that sticks to the top of the page while the user scrolls down the page alowing it to be accsessed at any point as the user clicks on the different pages a black line will stay under the name of the page they are on so that the usere wwent away from the device being used thay will know whe theyt get back. There are three pages to this site the home page (index.html), gallery page (gallert.html) that has my favourite images, and the information page (information.html). These pages have no pop up adds that could disstract the user away from the pages.
